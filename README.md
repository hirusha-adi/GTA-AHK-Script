Do things in GTA V like cheatcodes

example usage:
as you are typing cheatcodes in GTA SA or GTA VC, you can type the code while the game is running

as in this image, if you type "lester", the script will run and give a call to lester ( make sure to not to keep the phone up when doing this ), this will save a lot of time in game.. you can browse the script for more info about this
